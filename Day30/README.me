In this task, is based on crud operation.
To fetch the data through api , i used axios here
C - axois.post
R - axois.get
U - axois.put
D - axois.delete
above these are the command i used here  for performing crud opertion



We can do the crud opertion while the server runs in the local
but once we deployed in netlify , couldn't perform the crud operation .
Because of that , we can only read the fetched data
